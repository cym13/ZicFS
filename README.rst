Description
===========

ZicFS is a FUSE filesystem to auto-tag music files based on where they are
stored.

It is written in python.

**Work in progress**

Documentation
=============

Basics
------

ZicFS's primary function is to tag files based on where they are placed in
the directory structure. The default structure is as such:

    zicfs/author_name/album_title/track_title

Moving a file *baz* to *zicfs/foo/bar/baz* will automatically tag it with foo
as author, bar as album title and baz as track_title. Those tags are set in
the file metadata (ID3 for mp3, vorbis comment for the rest). That means that
if you copy it to your phone for example, it will recognize the tags too.

As this is a file system, you can use whatever you feel comfortable with to
manage your files, it will still work.

Meta files
----------

Such tagging is easy but limited. If you want to add more informations to
your files, zicfs provides another way: add a *.meta* file containing
additional tag informations somewhere in a zicfs directory and all files in
the subdirectories will be tagged with those tags as well. Note that the
deeper a *.meta* file is, the more it prevails over other informations. A
.meta file cannot overload a directory-based information.

For example, let's say we have the following directory structure:

::

    zicfs -+- LukHash -+- Psyche -+- DUB.mp3
           |           |
           |           +- .meta -> style="electro", album="Dead Pixels"
           |
           +- .meta -> style="Jazz", year=2007

Then DUB.mp3 will have the following tags:

::
    author = "LukHash"
    album  = "Psyche"
    title  = "DUB"
    style  = "electro"
    year   = 2007

Notice how the style was assigned from the nearest *.meta* file and the album
wasn't changed.

Other directory structures
--------------------------

We understand that this directory structure doesn't fit everybody's needs so
there is a way to specify your own pattern. Check the CLI documentation below
for more information.

Info files
----------

In order to get additional data about your filebase ZicFS provides a last
trick: an *INFO* file. Those files are not real files in that you can copy
or write to them. In fact an INFO file holds no data. When read, an *INFO*
file in a directory will dynamically fetch informations about all files in
subdirectories such as the complete list of existing tags.

    ZicFS: Music tagging filesystem

    Usage: zicfs [-hf] MUSIC_DIR MOUNT_POINT

    Arguments:
        MUSIC_DIR       Path to your music directory
        MOUNT_POINT     Where to mount ZicFS

    Options:
        -h, --help              Print this help and exit
        -f, --foreground        Do not daemonize ZicFS
        -p, --pattern PATTERN   Uses the directory architecture PATTERN
                                instead of the default one.

    Patterns:
        Defines how directories are laid out. The default one is:

            %{author}/%{album}/%{track}

        Available tags are:

            author: Musician's name
            album:  Album's title
            track:  Track's title
            year:   Year of release

Dependencies
============

- Linux as ZicFS depends on FUSE which is Linux only.
- fusepy
- mutagen
- docopt

Roadmap
=======

::
    [ ] Write a FUSE base mocking tagging functions
    [ ] Build mp3's ID3 by-directory tagging
    [ ] Build Vorbis comments by-directory tagging
    [ ] Add file-based additional tagging
    [ ] Get info files to work
    [ ] Add the possibility to specify a directory pattern
    [ ] Have fun!
